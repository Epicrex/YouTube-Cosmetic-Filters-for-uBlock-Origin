# YouTube-Cosmetic-Filters-for-uBlock-Origin
Cosmetic filters to improve the search results and home section.

Go to the uBlock Origin dashboard (press the uBlock button > press the button with 3 cogs). Open the tab called "filter lists" and scroll to the bottom. Check "import" and enter following URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Onsotumenh/YouTube-Cosmetic-Filters-for-uBlock-Origin/main/YouTubeFilterList.txt
Apply changes and reload YouTube. Enjoy!

If you only want certain filters, copy them out of the .txt and put them in the "my filters" tab in the uBlock dashboard. Those won't update when the repository updates.
